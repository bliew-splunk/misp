**Note:**
-   Create new events with the `create event` action.
-   To add a single attribute to an existing event use the `add attribute` action.
-   To add multiple attributes to an event, use the `bulk add attributes` action.
-   In the **'run query'** action, tags containing a comma (,) in its value can be passed through
    the 'other' action parameter. For example:

    -   other: {"tags": \["tag1, tag11", "tag_2"\]}

    "tag1, tag11" will be considered a single tag.
