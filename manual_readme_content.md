Misp will return integers which correspond to various values. Here is the complete list:  
  
For **distribution** :  

-   0: Your Org Only
-   1: This Community Only
-   2: Connected Communities
-   3: All Communities
-   4: Sharing Group
-   5: Inherit

**Note:**

-   Create new events with the `create event` action.
-   `create event` action supports add attributes while creating the event.
-   To add a single attribute to an existing event use the `add attribute` action.
    -   To add a single attribute using `json` paramter, pass json data as show below:
        ```
        {
            "category": "Network activity",
            "type": "comment",
            "value": "Example value for and event",
            "to_ids": true
        }
        ```
    - All the properties that can be added using the `json` parameter can be checked in the [misp documentation](https://www.misp-project.org/openapi/#tag/Attributes/operation/addAttribute)  
-   To add multiple attributes to an event, use the `bulk add attributes` action.
-   The `json` parameter of `create event` and `bulk add attribute` takes similar input. The user needs to pass a list of dictionaries in the format given below:
    ```
       [
             {
                "category": "Network activity",
                "type": "comment",
                "value": "Example value for and event 1",
                "to_ids": true
            },
            {
                "type": "comment",
                "value": "Example value for and event 2",
                "to_ids": false
            }
        ]
    ```
-   In the "**run query**" action, tags containing a comma (,) in its value can be passed through
    the 'other' action parameter. For example:

    -   other: {"tags": \["tag1, tag11", "tag_2"\]}

    "tag1, tag11" will be considered a single tag.
